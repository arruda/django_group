Suggested Guidelines
====================
I have discussed this issue with several of the administrators and users. Currently this group is lacking balance. Right now the volume of questions, with no effort on part of the user, is detracting from the group. It is also deterring the more experienced users from coming. Driving away the more experienced members would make the group irrelevant. The group needs a balance, and that should include questions showing clear effort and thought, tutorials, posts on django topics of interest to all, job opportunities and other professional information related to django.

Points and Guidelines:
---------------------------------------
1) Django is a web framework, and getting it to work requires an undertanding of how each of the three pieces, the model, view and controller work together. Before asking a question you should complete the offical [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/), or some similar tutorial. No one can help you if you do not have a basic understanding of the framework.

2) While there are many aspects to programming one of the most fundamental concepts is the ability to solve problems on your own. You need to try things yourself, when it does not work review your code, search the internet, and try again. And take breaks, clear your mind, then try again.You should only ask for help when you are truly stuck. 

3) Members are not going to do your homework or work, and expecting them to, is unprofessional and will not be permitted. They will help you help yourself, and guide you in most cases. If you are asking a question, please ensure you have searched for a solution first. More often than not, [StackOverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) will have a great answer to your question. When asking questions you need to show your own efforts and code. 

4) Please use [Gist GitHub](https://gist.github.com/) or a pastebin like [Fedora's Pastebin](http://paste.fedoraproject.org/) for large chunks of code. It helps both you and everyone reviewing it, making it visual easy to read because of formatting and color coding. For entire projects use [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

5) Spammers, and users using fake accounts to spam, will be blocked.

6) Disrepectful comments, name calling, and similar unprofessional behaviour will not be tolerated.
