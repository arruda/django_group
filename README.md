Suggested Guidelines
====================
I have discussed this issue with several of the administrators and users. Currently this group is lacking balance. Right now the volume of questions, with no effort on part of the user, is detracting from the group. It is also deterring the more experienced users from coming. Driving away the more experienced members would make the group irrelevant. The group needs a balance, and that should include questions showing clear effort and thought, tutorials, posts on django topics of interest to all, job opportunities and other professional information related to django.

Suggestions for new django programmers:
---------------------------------------
1) Django is a web framework, and getting it to work requires an undertanding of how each of the three pieces, the model, view and controller to work together. Before asking a question you should complete the offical [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/), or some similar tutorial. No one can help you if you do not have a basic understanding of the framework.

2) While there are many aspects to programming one of the most fundamental concepts is the ability to solve problems on your own. You need to try things yourself, when it does not work review your code, search the internet, and try again. And take breaks, clear your mind, then try again.You should only ask for help when you are truly stuck. Another useful concept for new coders, and even experienced ones, is psuedocode.

3) Please use [Gist GitHub](https://gist.github.com/) or a pastebin like [Fedora's Pastebin](http://paste.fedoraproject.org/) for large chunks of code. It helps both you and everyone reviewing it, making it visual easy to read because of formatting and color coding. For entire projects use [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

Posts that violate this group:
------------------------------
1) Spammers, and users using fake accounts to spam, will be blocked. No one is here to buy sun glasses, etc.

2) Many members here actively help people, they just expect you do show effort on your part. If you are asking a question, please ensure you have searched for a solution first. More often than not, www.stackoverflow.com will have a great answer to your question. Questions that you have not tried to find an answer for; shown your own work and some effort will not be permitted. Members are not going to do your homework or work, and expecting them to is unprofessional. They will help you help yourself, and guide you in most cases.

3) Sharing other pages, or your page that is not directly related to django. We know there are other pages and groups out there on facebook related to Computer Progamming and Web Development. If we need to learn more, we can find these pages on our own.

4) Any tech postings not related to django will be deleted. Any repeat offenders will be deleted and banned from the group.

5) Any job recruiting not related to django or Web Applications using Python will be removed and repeated violations you will be banned. 

6) Political posts or political ideologies do not belong here. This group is for discussion the django framework and python programming language not a place to push our ideologies onto other people.

7) Disrepectful comments, name calling, and similar unprofessional behaviour will not be tolerated.

Job Postings:
--------------------------
1) Multiple posts are fine per job opportunity. You're also welcome to include an email address, phone number or some other way to contact you.
