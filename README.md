5 things to enjoy the most of this group.
-----------------------------------------

1) There is no shorcut for learning. Enjoy the many [beginners resources](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=django+for+beginners).

2) Do not expect people to do your homework for you. [Google](www.google.com) and [StackOverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) are your friends!

3) Facebook can't deal with code snippets. Share them via [Gist GitHub](https://gist.github.com/) or [Pastebin](http://paste.fedoraproject.org/).

4) Being a jerk in response to an arguably bad question is MUCH worse than the question.

5) Have fun!
